Avida 2.13 Release Notes

The following items are  features and changes present in this release of
Avida.

New Features:

- Environment Reaction Requisite : Reaction Max/Min Count Support

    Reaction requisites now support reaction_max_count and reaction_min_count.
    These requisites refer to the number of times the specific reaction has
    been triggered, regardless of how many times the referenced task has been
    performed.

- SavePopulation now supports saving only the current population, see Changes



Enhancements:

-



Changes:

- cHardwareCPU first time Costs now honor DIVIDE_METHOD = OFFSPRING (0)

    cHardwareCPU no longer resets first time cost counts when DIVIDE_METHOD
    is set to DIVIDE_METHOD_OFFSPRING (0).  Other hardware types are not
    current affected.

- SavePopulation action argument format change

    The action arguments now follow standard argument syntax:
      argument_name=argumentvalue:argument2_name=argument2_value
    Save population accepts two arguments:
      filename - default=detail
        a string that is used to prefix the update number and file extension,
        i.e.  detail-100.spop
      save_historic - default=1
        a boolean (0 or 1) value that determines whether the action saves the
        full history for the current population

- "collect" instruction family nop-specification change

		Previously, the collect family of instructions required the number of
    resources to be a power of the number of nops; Avida would crash otherwise.
    The new nop-specification method fixes this issue, reading the specification
    as a range in which to choose a resource to manipulate.  The resource is
    chosen randomly within this range, weighted by how much of the range the
    resource occupies.  In the standard 9-resource 3-nop system this behaves in
    the same way as the previous specification method.

- START_CREATURE/START_ORGANISM Removed

    Use Inject actions at the beginning of your experiment to specify exactly
    how you would like the experiment to be seeded.



Deprecated features will be removed in the next version of Avida.



Deprecated Features that will be removed in 2.14:

- HARDWARE_TYPE Setting and INST_SET File Deprecated

    Use the new instruction set format instead.  Backward compatibility may be
    activated by setting the avida.cfg option INST_SET_LOAD_LEGACY to 1.  The
    name of the instruction set will be the filename/path specified in INST_SET.



Known Issues:

- The PARENT_MUT_RATE setting will cause the parent's genome to mutate when
  it gives birth, but currently it is not treated like a second offspring, so
  the genotype will not be changed, and in general it cannot act with many
  other settings (like mutation reversions)

- BIRTH_METHOD 7 is currently a local birth method, but not grouped with the
  rest of them.  This required a special condition in cBirthChamber.cc for
  local recombination and in cPopulation.cc for offspring facing parent.
