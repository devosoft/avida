/*
 It'd be nice to encapsulate this into a RunTime class.  Unfortunately, the actual
 RuntimeLoop function needs to be exposed to emscripten and cannot be a member method.
 So, we're going to do this the old fashioned way and play pass the driver while
 exposing some potentially dangerous retrieval functions
 on the driver object to delete it... through deleting its cWorld!
 
 The driver itself contains all information about a single experiment.  It is a little
 strange, though, since the driver moves the world but the driver also contains the world
 and the world, the driver.  It's best to think of Creating/Resetting/Deleting the Driver
 in this header as doing both at the same time to the world and the driver.  
 
 NEVER delete the driver object directly.  ALWAYS delete it through DeleteDriver().
 
 This is because the cWorld destructor actually deletes our driver.  They refer
 to one another, and this is the traditional behavior that I don't want to muck
 with.
