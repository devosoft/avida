--------------------
- added documentation to
  tools/datafile.hh
  tools/file.hh
  tools/string.hh
  tools/struct.hh
  tools/tools.hh
  tools/random.hh
  tools/memtrack.hh
  tools/memory.hh
  tools/int.hh
  tools/debug.hh
  tools/tMatrix.hh
  tools/tVector.hh
  tools/tArray.hh

- reformatted documentation in
  cpu/cpu.hh
  cpu/cpu_stats.hh
  cpu/creature.hh
  cpu/environment.hh
  cpu/hardware.hh
  cpu/head.hh
  cpu/label.hh

- commented out code in lookup.hh, lookup.cc. Apparently
  the code in these files is not needed (and also it is not
  very efficient).

- moved inline functions from tools.hh to tools.ii
- moved inline functions from random.hh to random.ii
- moved inline functions from memory.hh to memory.ii
- moved inline functions from debug.hh to debug.ii

- added some options to configure. You can use it now to determine whether
  you want to compile with or without viewer.

Kaben, 2003-05-17
--------------------
- source and build changes for crossplatform compatibility.  We can
  build on Linus, Mac OS X, and Windows XP (though this last is a little
  rough right now).

- incorporated changes to hardware_cpu and instruction library
  - hardware_cpu now has a static instruction superlibrary containing
    all available functions and instruction names.
  - instruction library now indexes into the superlibrary tables.
  - windows compatibility required the change from the old code.
