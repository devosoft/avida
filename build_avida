# Unfortunately, there is no way to handle switching toolchains inside
# of a CMakeLists.txt file.  It must be done on the commandline.  So,
# instead of having a cmake option, we must use a wrapper script to configure
# the build system for emscripten.
# To build the javascript version of the console:
#       ./build_avida avida.js
# To build a web gui:
#       ./build_avida avida.html
#
# Please note the comments on setting the configuration files below. 
# They *must* be set prior to compilation.
#
# This script requires that the shell environment be aware of emcripten.
# Please use the emscripten sdk ./set_env.sh script to handle this
# configuration.
