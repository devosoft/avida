<h2 align=center>Environment Task Implementation Checklist</h2>

<p>
This document discusses how to implement your own tasks to use as triggers
for reactions in the environment.

<h3>1. Build the prototype of the method that will be used to test the new task</h3>

<p>
    For this step, you will be editing the task library found in the files
    tasks.cc and tasks.hh in the directory source/main/.  Start by adding
    the prototype of your new test function to the cTaskLib class in the
    header (tasks.hh) file.  The data that will be tested is all stored within
    the library, so this function takes no inputs and outputs a double that
    represents the "quality" with which the task is performed.  This is a
    number between 0 and 1 that determines the fraction of the bonus that
    should be received.  For tasks that are either successful or not, this
    will only return 0.0 or 1.0.

<p>
    For example, if we were going to create a task that tests if the
    organisms could double one of their inputs, we might call that task
    "times2".  We would then add the line to this file:

<pre>
   void <font color="#008800">Task_Times2</font>();
</pre>

<p>
    If possible, place it near other tasks of the same type.  In this case,
    I choose to place it directly after Task_Echo(), since this is also an
    easy task for the organisms to perform.

<h3>2. Build the body of the method that will be used to test the new task</h3>

<p>
    We next go into the code (tasks.cc) file, and add the body of our new
    method.  We search for cTaskLib::Task_Echo(), since our new prototype
    followed this method in the header file, and place the body of our
    function immediately after it.

<pre>
   <font color="#880000">double</font> <font color="#880000">cTaskLib</font>::<font color="#008800">Task_Times2</font>() const
   {
     const <font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">test_output</font> = <font color="#000088">output_buffer</font>[0];
     for (<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">i</font> = 0; <font color="#000088">i</font> < <font color="#000088">input_buffer</font>.<font color="#008800">GetNumStored</font>(); <font color="#000088">i</font>++) {
       if (2 * <font color="#000088">input_buffer</font>[i] == <font color="#000088">test_output</font>) {
         return 1.0;
       }
     }
     return 0.0;
   }
</pre>
    

<p>
    The most recent output is always placed at the beginning of the output
    buffer, so we store it in the variable
    <font color="#000088">test_output</font> to compare it against all of the
    different inputs.  We then have a for-loop that goes from 1 to the number
    of inputs stored in the input buffer.  Inside the body of the loop, we
    test for each input if twice that input is equal to the output.  If so,
    then the task was successful and we return a 1.0.  If all of the tests
    fail and we exit the loop, then we return a 0.0.

<p>
    These test methods should be carefully written so that they run as fast
    as possible.  In particular, if a task requires that an output be
    compared to multiple inputs at a time (i.e., the tasks Add or Subtract),
    then this can become combinartoically explosive.  For the moment, we
    keep control on this problem by only allowing three different inputs
    in the input buffer, but in the future this number may need to become
    higher.

<h3>3. Attach our new method to the name of its trigger</h3>

    This next step is also done in the code file, inside the
    <font color="#880000">cTaskLib</font>::<font color="#008800">AddTask</font>()
    method.  Again, we want this to be in the same place, so we locate the
    task "echo" that its supposed to follow, and add in the new line.

<pre>
   else if (<font color="#000088">name</font> == "times2") <font color="#008800">NewTask</font>(<font color="#000088">name</font>, "Times2", &<font color="#880000">cTaskLib</font>::<font color="#008800">Task_Times2</font>);
</pre>    

<p>
    This line will attach the name to the description "Times2" (which could
    have been a little more detailed, but should be 40 characters or less)
    as well as to the function that should be called when that name is
    listed as a trigger to a reaction.

<p>
    You are now ready to use your task!
