<h2 align=center>Instruction Implementation Checklist</h2>

<p>
This document discusses how to implement your own instructions.

<h3>1. Build the method to be attached to the new instruction</h3>

<p>
For this first step, you will be editing the virtual CPU definition in 
<tt>hardware_cpu.hh</tt> and <tt>hardware_cpu.cc</tt>, both of which are
found in the directory <tt>current/source/cpu/</tt>.  Start by going to the
final section of the class definition in the header file (*.hh) and writing
the declaration for the new method that will be called whenever the
instruction is executed.
For example, if you were going to add the instruction "<tt>minus-17</tt>"
(which performs the oh-so-useful behavior of subtracting 17 from the
?BX? register), you would add the line:<br>

<pre>
   <font color="#880000">bool</font> <font color="#008800">Inst_Minus17</font>();
</pre>

<p>
If possible, place it near other instructions of the same type.  Only
a few samples were given in your handout, but there are about a hundred
methods in the actual file.  This instruction would likely fit best with
the group of instruction described as "Single-Argument Math".  That is,
all those instructions that perform mathematical operation that only affect a
single register.

<p>
All methods associated with instructions return a
<font color="#880000">bool</font> value that determines if it were
successfully executed, and take in no arguments.  Most instructions will
always return true since they have now way to fail.  The convention
that we use to designate a method explicitly associated with an instruction
is placing a prefix of <tt>Inst_</tt> in front of it.

<p>
Next, you have to write the function body in the code file
(<tt>hardware_cpu.cc</tt>).  The method bodies will be listed at the end
of this file in the same order that they were declared in the header.
You would find the proper position, and write something to the effect of:

<pre>
  void <font color="#880000">cHardwareCPU</font>::<font color="#008800">Inst_Minus17</font>()
  {
    const <font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">reg_used</font> = <font color="#008800">FindModifiedRegister</font>(REG_BX);
    <font color="#008800">Register</font>(<font color="#000088">reg_used</font>) -= 17;   <font color="#886600">
    // Same as:  Register(reg_used) = Register(reg_used) - 17;</font>
    return true;
  }
</pre>

<p>
The first line of this method uses a helper function called
<font color="#008800">FindModifiedRegister</font>() to identify the register
that should be affected (it scans the next instruction to test if it is a
<tt>nop</tt>), with a default value of <tt>REG_BX</tt> passed in.
The second line then subtracts 17 from the value in that register.  The
constant values and available helper functions will be described in more
detail below, as will a guide to accessing the components in the virtual
CPU.  For the moment, you have finished implementing the method!

<p>
Note that this would be a good time to recompile if you want to test how
well your implementation is going so far.

<h3>2. Link the instruction name to its method</h3>

For this step, you will need to edit the file "<tt>hardware_util.cc</tt>"
in the <tt>current/source/cpu/</tt> directory.  You would go into the method
<font color="#880000">cHardwareUtil</font>::<font color="#008800">LoadInstLibCPU</font>()
and add in the line

<pre>
  <font color="#000088">inst_dict</font>.<font color="#008800">Add</font>("minus-17", (<font color="#880000">tHardwareMethod</font>) &<font color="#880000">cHardwareCPU</font>::<font color="#008800">Inst_Minus17</font>);
</pre>

<p>
in the same order that it was defined in the class definition.

<p>
The instruction dictionary will be passed into the
<font color="#008800">LoadInstLib</font>() method to determine which
functions will actually be put in the instruction library.  Here we add a
single entry to it that correlates the instruction name "<tt>minus-17</tt>"
with the method that is supposed to be called when that instruction is
executed.

<p>
Since we want to use a pointer to the appropriate method, that is what we
must pass into the dictionary.  To obtain said pointer, we must list the class
the function is part of (<font color="#880000">cHardwareCPU</font>) follow it
by a double colon (::) and then give the method name
(<font color="#008800">Inst_Minus17</font>) <i>without</i> the normal
parentheses following it.  The parenthesis indicate that we should execute
the method.  Without it, it is just the data that represents the method,
and by preceding this whole mess with an ampersand ('&') we get the pointer
to the location in memory that the method resides.  And before all of this
we indicate that what is coming is a Hardware method to prep it for being
entered into the dictionary.

<p>
A type name in parenthesis means that the variable that follows should be
converted to this type.  In the case of this section of code, there can be
many different types of function pointers, so we want to make sure that we
keep them uniform for the moment.  In truth, since we only have one type of
virtual CPU, this conversion isn't really needed yet, but will be useful in
the future when other types of hardware are possible.

<p>
Compile again, and you should have your instruction ready for use.

<h3>3. Add the entry to your instruction set and test it!</h3>

<p>
This last part should be the easiest.  If you want the new instruction you
just created to be loaded on startup, you must add a line in the instruction
set you are using (specified in the genesis file) to indicate its inclusion:

<pre>
  minus-17 1
</pre>

<p>
And there you have it!  Now the real trick is to test if its working 
properly.  I'd recommend using as a framework the creature
"<tt>organism.heads.100</tt>" and modifying some of the long series of
"<tt>nop-C</tt>" instructions inside of it to perform some math using the
new instruction (only the very first <tt>nop-C</tt> cannot be changed).  You
can then either go into zoom mode in the viewer and step through the
creature, or else use analyze mode trace its execution.  If you are going
to use zoom mode, setup your modified creature as the START_CREATURE in
genesis.  If you want to use analyze mode, put the following lines into the
<tt>analyze.cfg</tt> file in your work/ directory:

<pre>
  LOAD_ORGANISM organism.inst_test
  TRACE
</pre>

<p>
Where you have to replace <tt>organism.inst_test</tt> with the name of the
organism you want to trace.  The new file will appear in the <tt>genebank/</tt>
directory, with the same name as the one you loaded in, but a "<tt>.trace</tt>"
appended to the end.

<h3>CPU Components</h3>

<p>
The various CPU components are often manipulated by instructions, and we
need a standard way of doing this.  We have settled on each component being
associated with a method to access it, to provide a single location that can
control that access.  This has already been useful -- in a multi-threaded 
CPU (i.e., a CPU that has multiple positions in its genome being executed at
the same time) each thread has its own registers and heads, so we need to
always be sure we are manipulating the component of the active thread.  If
you simply use the following methods, they will always find the correct
component for you.

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><tt>void <font color="#008800">StackPush</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">value</font>);<br>
<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#008800">StackPop</font>();<br>
void <font color="#008800">SwitchStack</font>();</tt><br>
There are two stacks in a normal CPU, and more in a multi-threaded version
(one global stack, and one local to each thread).  The first stack method will
place a new value on the top of the currently active stack, the second will
remove the top value, and the last will toggle the currently active stack.

<tr><td><font color="#880000">cCPUHead</font> & <font color="#008800">GetHead</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">head_id</font>);<br>
        <font color="#880000">cCPUHead</font> & <font color="#008800">IP</font>();<br>
Each thread in a CPU has four heads associated with it, designated by the
constants <tt>HEAD_IP</tt>, <tt>HEAD_READ</tt>, <tt>HEAD_WRITE</tt>, and 
<tt>HEAD_FLOW</tt>.  These heads each point to a position in memory, and all
have their own purpose.  I will discuss exactly how to use heads at a latter
point, but for the moment just know that a head can be accessed by passing
the appropriate constant into the GetHead() method.  The extra method IP()
was added to more easily obtain just the instruction pointer.  The IP is a
very special head since it designates what instruction is going to be
executed next, and often it will make code clearer if you obtain it by calling
IP().  (It will show that you need to make sure of the special qualities of
the instruction pointer.)

<tr><td><font color="#880000">int</font> & <font color="#008800">Register</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">reg_id</font>);<br>
There are three registers available, associated with the constants
<tt>REG_AX</tt>, <tt>REG_BX</tt>, and <tt>REG_CX</tt>.  If the Register()
method is called, an integer reference will be returned associated with that
register.  Any change to this integer will make a corresponding change to
the register in question.

<tr><td><font color="#880000">cCPUMemory</font> & <font color="#008800">Memory</font>();<br>
This method allows the programmer to access the full memory of the CPU.  As
you know, the class cCPUMemory is built on top of cGenome, so you can
manipulate it in all of the same ways.

</table>

These are only a sampling of the available methods of interacting with the
components of the CPU, but they give you a good cross-section without
overwhelming you with all of the possibilities.  You should look through the
source files if you want to see the other options that are available to you.

<h3>Helper Methods</h3>

<p>
There are several very common tasks that are performed during the execution
of many of the instructions.  For each of these tasks we have created a
helper function to ease the creation of new instructions.

<table cellpadding=5>
<tr><td>void <font color="#008800">ReadLabel</font>();<br>
        <font color="#880000">cCodeLabel</font> & <font color="#008800">GetLabel</font>();<br>
        <font color="#880000">cCPUHead</font> <font color="#008800">FindLabel</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">direction</font>);<br>
ReadLabel() will read in the label (series of nop instructions) that
immediately follows the instruction being executed.  The label that was read
can then be accessed (and even modified)  using GetLabel().  Finally, the
Findlabel() method takes single int argument that determines the direction
(from the instruction pointer) in which the label should be search for.  If
this argument is a 1 it will search forward, and if its a -1, it will search
backwards.  A zero indicates that the search should start from the beginning
of the genome, and proceed to the end.  Once it finds the matching label, it
will return a head at the position in which the label was found.  These
helper methods are particularly useful in any instruction that has to affect
other portions of the source code.  See the method Inst_HeadSearch for an
example of how these are used.

<tr><td><font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#008800">FindModifiedRegister</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">default_register</font>);<br>
        <font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#008800">FindModifiedHead</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">default_head</font>);<br>
These two methods will look ahead and determine if a nop instruction is
immediately following the instruction being executed.  If so, it will return
the register or head ID associated with that nop (for use in the rest of the
method), and if no nop is found, it will automatically return the
default value passed in.  We used FindModifiedRegister in the example new
instruction above.

<tr><td><font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#008800">FindComplementRegister</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">base_reg</font>);<br>
Several instructions are defined as affecting a certain, modifiable register
and its complement.  In order to have a standard way of determining the
complement of a register (which, by default, cycle in the same order as
complement labels), we use this function whenever we need to determine one.
See, for example, see the definition of Inst_IfNEqu() in the handout for the
file <tt>hardware_cpu.cc</tt>.

<tr><td>void <font color="#008800">Fault</font>(<font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">fault_loc</font>, <font color="#880000">int</font> <font color="#000088">fault_type</font>, <font color="#880000">cString</font> <font color="#000088">fault_desc</font>="");<br>
This helper function should be called whenever an instruction cannot perform
its operation successfully.  Ideally, most instructions should do something
meaningful in any situation so that faults are unnecessary, but sometimes
this doesn't work out well.  The input argument "<tt>fault_loc</tt>" should
tell where the fault is stemming from to help the user trace it back.  The
range of possible fault locations can be found in the file
<tt>cpu_defs.hh</tt>, but you can use <tt>FAULT_LOC_DEFAULT</tt> in most
cases.  The next input in the fault type, which is either FAULT_TYPE_ERROR
in the case that the creature actively made a mistake (such as trying to
divide before copying an offspring, or trying to take the square root of a
negative number), or else FAULT_TYPE_WARNING if its not directly the
creature's fault, such as if it is trying to interact with another creature
that has just died (it couldn't help the fact that the other creature died).
Finally, a string should be given that describes the reason for the fault
(this will be readable by humans that are stepping through the organism.)
The main reason for faults at the moment is to help us debug an organism.
Faults can also be made lethal to the organisms if we want them to develop
more "correct" code.

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>
To test your understanding of adding instruction into avida, try writing two
new instructions.  The
first one is the mathematical instruction "<b><tt>cube</tt></b>" which will
take the ?BX? register, and put its value to the third power.  If you look
in the actual source files, you will see that there is already a
"<tt>square</tt>" instruction that you can model this on.

<p>
Next, you will implement the instruction "<b><tt>if-twice</tt></b>" which
will execute the next instruction if-and-only-if the value in the ?BX?
register is twice that of the value in its complement.  In other words by
default, if would test of BX was twice CX, but if it is followed by a
<tt>nop-C</tt> it will test if CX is twice AX.

<p>
For both of these instruction make sure to craft an organism to test that
they are working properly!  Turn in this organism (or organisms) to me along
with the source code when you finish the assignment.
