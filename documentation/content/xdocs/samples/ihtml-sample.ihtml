<h1><a name="intro" />Interpreted HTML (ihtml) demonstration page</h1>
		
<p>This HTML document is used as the source for this page, and translated
to the intermediate Apache Forrest xdocs document structure. The sitemap then
does the normal aggregation with the navigation content and application of
the skin.
</p>

<p>
Note that this source file has the .ihtml filename extension. All requests to
the sitemap for *.html are served by looking for matching *.ihtml source,
or by the
<a href="http://forrest.apache.org/faq.html#link_raw">"raw content"</a>
method, or by the normal processing of structured xml xdocs format, or by
other specialised xml processing.
</p>

<p>
The ihtml is being interpreted by Forrest and transformed to the
intermediate Apache xdocs document structure. That stylesheet cannot deal
with every possibility in unstructured html, so it tries to guess how to
build &lt;section&gt; elements and such.
It needs &lt;h1&gt; (&lt;h2&gt; etc.) headings in the source ihtml
(and the page must start with a h1 element). Patches are welcome to enhance
that transformer.
</p>

<p>All linked-to pages are also available, for example
<a href="../test2.html">this one</a>.</p>

<p>
You can still take advantage of Forrest's
<a href="http://forrest.apache.org/docs/linking.html">"<b>site:<b>"
method of linking</a>, for example:
<a href="site:index">&lt;a href="site:index"&gt;</a>
</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Note:</b> XHTML can also be used, but it is just treated as interpreted
html. Future versions of Forrest will take much more advantage of XHTML.
</p>
<hr>

<h1><a name="examples" />Some example uses of ihtml</h1>
<p>
There are situations when the Apache Forrest xdocs DTD is not sufficient.
This interpreted html enables such extra capabilities.
